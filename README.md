In this project, a simple Iris Recognition System is built with MATLAB.
MMU Dataset had been used as dataset for this work and it is not added in the current project due to copyright claims.
MMU Dataset can be found here:

After the dataset installation, dataset should be renamed as MMU and needs to be located under the same directory of this project.
